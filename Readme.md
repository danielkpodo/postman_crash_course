## TESTING API'S WITH POSTMAN

- Postman acts as an interface for interacting with a server that has some data
- Workspaces in postman allows you to organize your work better

### ESSENTIAL PARTS

- Overview of the interface
- Workspaces
- Request Area
- Response Area
- Collections: A list of multiple requests typicallly connected to the same api

### SELF NOTES

- Use variables to extract common parameters. e.g baseUrl
- The initial value is what people will see publicly when you share the api
- For secrets we use them in the current value (In your postman the current value is what you are using)
- Query parameters passed must be validated
- Make a comment to specify optional query parameterss
